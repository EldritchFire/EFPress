title: Playing with the Deck of Fate, Part 1
---

I very much enjoy having tactile bits to play with at the table—dice, counters, chits, etc—so cards are a natural extension to my love of _stuff_. When the Deck of Fate was announced, I purchased a copy right away.

However, there hasn't been much done with it since. Neither official “support” or fan-made uses. Today, I'm going to start what I hope is a long line of fun things you can use the Deck of Fate to do.

## Hand of Dice
When you play Fate, you roll 4dF each time the GM calls for a roll. Instead of rolling dice, play cards from your hand!

With this system, you need one Deck of Fate for your entire group. Each player draws a hand of cards, and each time a (re)roll is called for, you can either play a card from your hand or draw the top card of the deck.

### Hand Size
When you first sit down to play for the evening, draw a hand of cards equal to your _unmodified_ refresh: 3 for a standard Fate Core/Accelerated game, 5 for _Atomic Robo_, 7 for Jadepunk, etc.

GMs get one card per player—the same amount as their per-scene fate point allotment.

### Playing a Card
Whenever the GM calls for a roll, you instead get to play one card from your hand. This gives you the option of how well—or poorly—you do. If it's not that important of a "roll" you can play a lower-value card. If it's something you _really_ want to succeed, play a high card!

Of course, if you don't want to use a card from your hand, you always have the option to draw from the deck. This lets you hold on to a really good hand for when it matters most. Beware, though, since you can loose your hand if an eclipse card is played!

### Shuffle and Deal
If one of the three eclipse cards are played—the 4 +s, 4 -s, or 4 blanks—the entire deck is reshuffled after the action is concluded, and a new hand is dealt to each player.

If you ever play your last card, you also redraw a new hand.

## New Stunt Space
Using the Deck of Fate instead of dice also gives us a new playground for stunts! For example, you could have a stunt that lets you draw more cards, discard a card or two from a new hand, keep a card when an eclipse is played, or even using the sun/moon/eclipse symbols on the cards for stunt triggers!

For example:

* **Power of the Moon.** When _[specific aspect]_ is invoked for a reroll, add +1 for each moon symbol on the card played.
* **Ace in the Hole.** If you only have one card in hand and it's a Fair (+2) or better, you may show it to the table and pay one fate point to draw a new hand, keeping your last card.
* **Luck be a Lady Tonight.** When you draw a new hand of cards, you may discard and redraw one card. If that card is Fair (+2) or better, you may discard and redraw another.
