When playing Fate face-to-face with your friends, you refresh your Fate Points at the beginning of each session. That's all well and good, but I don't play much face-to-face anymore, most of my gaming is PbP these days.

So how does one reconcile Fate Point refresh with games that don't have sessions? I call it the **Refresh Scene**.

## What is it?
A refresh scene is a take of the idea of transition scenes in MHR. When your characters have some downtime to rest up and relax, you can call for a refresh scene. At the end of a refresh scene, you refresh your Fate Points.

In order to call for a refresh scene, you need to meet three criterion:

* Have a good night's sleep
* Take a nice warm shower
* Eat a hearty meal

Or the equivalent, of course. If you're a vampire who sleeps during the day, substitute a good day's sleep, instead. Also, if baths are more your thing, then a nice warm bath. Or, if you're Harry Dresden, take a nice cold shower.

The point is, you need to be well rested, well fed, and clean.

## Why Those Three?
Why those three, you ask? It's because these three things are what most people do to feel refreshed. They're well rested, clean, and fed.

Besides, read any of Dresden's case files. He's running around like a crazy person, dragging his ass through who knows what, wearing himself down. When he finally has time to eat more than cereal and Coke, take a good shower, and sleep, he's more awake and alert. In game terms, he's hit a refresh scene and gotten his Fate Points back.

## How Often?
Remember that a significant milestone is at the end of a scenario, or 2-3 sessions (page 258). Meaning you should have 2-3 opportunities for a refresh scene in each scenario. More heroic or over-the-top might allow for more refresh scenes, while gritter games would not have as many.

It's a pretty easy way to help control the refresh of Fate Points! However, keep in mind if any of your players has a refresh of only 1. They get the least benefit of refresh scenes (and refreshing Fate Points in general), so they will be the least likely to want or need one.
