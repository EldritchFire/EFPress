title: 'Shadowcraft: The Glamour War'

I've got some great news that I can finally talk about! Reroll Productions, the company that brought us *Jadepunk: Tales from Kausao City* has hired me to work on mechanics for their newest Fate game: *Shadowcraft: The Glamour War*!

I'm really excited to be working with all the fine Reroll people on this, and it marks my second professional job writing for someone else. The first was for The Fate Codex: Vol. 1, Issue 3 last year.

So far there's not much to tell, so I'll leave you with a [link](http://rerollproductions.com/shadowcraft-coming-to-kickstarter/) and the promo image:
