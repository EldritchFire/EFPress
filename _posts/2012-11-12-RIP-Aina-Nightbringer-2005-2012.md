I’ve been hemming and hawing about whether to post this or not for a few weeks now, but I decided to so so. I think it would be a disservice to my fictional hero and the game that made it all possible.

## What?
Good question! Aina Nightbringer was my first successful character in *City of Heroes*. She was a darkness manipulator who used the power the Netherworld to aid her allies. The game has closed it’s servers at the end of last month, so we will never again adventure together in this incarnation. In game terms, she was a [Dark Miasma](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Dark_Miasma)/[Dark Blast](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Dark_Blast) [Defender](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Defender). I never managed to get her past level 38, but she will always be my favorite. You never forget your first, right? I wish I had a picture of her to share, but I got rid of my laptop a longtime ago, having switched over to my iPad, and didn’t have time or opportunity to get a screencap of her.

## How?
Aina came from humble origins, being evicted from her home in the [Rogue Isles](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Rogue_Isles) by minions of [Arachnos](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Arachnos). She did what she had to do in order to survive the slums, including participating in “medical trials” for paltry amounts of money.

It was in one of those trials where she found her confidence—and her freedom. Arachnos was doing experiments on her and others of her volunteer group to see if they could give people an affinity for manipulating Dark Energy. It was torturous for her and he companions, but it’s not like they had a choice.

After long weeks of experimentation, Aina was in for a long night. Fortunately for her, the scientist was a bit too groggy, and upped her exposure to dangerous levels. Combined with the prior weeks tweaking with her genetics, Aina took to the energy in a flash—figuratively, of course, since darkness doesn’t flash! She used he newly given powers to free herself and the others in her test group.

With her new powers as yet untested, she made her way from the Rogue Isles to [Paragon City](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Paragon_City) to throw in her lot with the heroes sworn to stop Arachnos.
