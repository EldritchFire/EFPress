## Brand New Patreon
If you are one of my patrons—or are interesting in becoming one—head on over to my Patreon page. I've done a complete revamp of it. Different milestones, different pledge levels, the works.

## What's New?
New stuff includes a monthly pledge instead of a per-article pledge, a quarterly PDF of all (non-review) articles, and the option for G+ Hangouts! I'm hoping that the new format will entice more people to support what I'm doing and have a more active hand in my content.
