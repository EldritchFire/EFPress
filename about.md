I'm an accountant by trade, but a gamer at heart. I play all kinds of games: board games, table-top RPGs, console games, and computer games. My first love was and still  is Star Wars but I still enjoy other Sci Fi shows: Star Trek, Doctor Who, Warehouse 13, Supernatural, etc.

I love dice of all shapes and sizes, and I speak French.
